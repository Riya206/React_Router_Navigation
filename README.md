**Working Principle**
The navigation bar contains links to different routes.
When user clicks a link → URL changes.
React Router renders corresponding component.
Products are stored in arrays and displayed using map().
No page reload occurs (Single Page Application behavior).

Dynamic product listing
Responsive card layout
Simple reusable styling
